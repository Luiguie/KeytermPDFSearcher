# KeytermPDFSearcher
Simple PDF Searcher via CMD and .exe using python

Sometimes you'll need to know if a certain code or name is mentioned in a specific set of PDF files, searching each and every one of these PDFs could take a long time, that's why I created this simple PDF Searcher 

All that you need to do is follow the commands provided on the CMD or .exe and the search will happen automatically, given you the name and page of the PDF that the keyword was found.

I recommend you to be specific, as searching for "Dias" when trying to Search for "Luis Dias" may lead to errors within the algorithm.

If you would like to build the ".exe" version into a actually .exe, I recommend the usage of pyinstaller.

Thank you for using my code, cheers
